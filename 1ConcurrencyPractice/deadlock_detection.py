"""
A deadlock happens when:

Two (or more) threads/processes are waiting on each other

And none can proceed, because they're all holding resources the others need

Classic Example:
ðŸ§µ Thread A holds Lock 1, wants Lock 2

ðŸ§µ Thread B holds Lock 2, wants Lock 1

They both wait forever â†’ ðŸ’¥ Deadlock
